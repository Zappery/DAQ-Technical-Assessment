# Brainstorming

First time using any of these, haven't touched Javascript or Typescript before. Learning on the fly!!

Task 1
 - Changed the problematic line format to stringify and this worked to solve the crashing issue
 - Tried to understand the try catch error but it was confusing (haven't used Javascript/Typescript before) and looked online for alternative solution (in which stringify seems to work and resolve the error)

Task 2
 - Pretty sure there would be way more optimal solutions than the way I did this but it gets it done
 - Placed what I coded in the receiving of the message module. This meant that I was able to get the message received without fiddling much with the rest of the code which I haven't fully understood
 - Stripped the string message received and got the numbers for the battery temperature and timestamp from the string 
 - Converted them to integers to check with operators whether they are exceeding the temperature range
 - If it exceeds and has an error more than 3 times in a 5 sec span, writes the timestamp at the log file
 - Variable naming and intrinsic documentation diminished here as I just tried to get everything to work

Task 3
 - Cannot do, need deeper understanding of React and JSX.
 - Attempted to no avail. Stuck on how to create a function which changes the colourValue without messing up everything
