# Brainstorming

First time using any of these, haven't touched Javascript or Typescript before.

have to learn typescript & javascript in 7 days cuz i saw email late great

still have no clue what currJSON actually is or what its meant to be doing. but stringify seems to solve it yay!

"npm install" on all sub folders to get working and start again from git idk why doenst work without

NEXT steps:
1. fix number[0] and number [1] error, if battery error (>80), there is no decimal value so timestamp gets added on to temp
Add a feature to the backend streaming service so that each time the received battery temperature exceeds this range more than 3 times in 5 seconds, the current timestamp is logged to a file named 'incidents.log'.
